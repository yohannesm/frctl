L-system:

L = draw the leaf recursively
Lt = draw terminating leaf
Fr = draw Fruit
B = draw Branch recursively
Bt = draw terminating branch
[ = Push
] = Pop
rz(angle) = rotate with respect to z axis by ("angle" degree);
rx(angle) = rotate with respect to x axis by ("angle" degree);

Axiom:
 base: [ Fr ] [ T ]
 rec Case:
    B -> base = Bt
         rec Case = B
    Tg( zAng = 10) Sg(xAng=15) Sg(xAng=-10, zAng =-35) Sg(zAng=40) 
    Tg( xAng = -25, zAng = 20) Tg (xAng = -25)


Rule
Tg  "growing the top" -> [ rz(zAng) rx(xAng) B [ L ] ]
Sg  "growing the side" -> [ rz(zAng) rx(xAng) L ]


Extra Credits feature:
1. we draw the simple animation of our plants growing, this can be achieved by the 
    key press 'g'(5)
2. We include fruits(5)
3. We improve the extrusion of the branch so it's using a smooth surface to make
    it more realistic(5)
4. We use a different complicated L-system to get interesting plants. (5)
5. We use a 3D L-system and rotate in the y and x directions(10)
6. We vary the colors of the polygon (5)

Questions answer:
1. The plant looks more realistic in 3D with perspective view as this is how we 
   normally view things. Near branches appear larger while farther branches 
   appear smaller. Also we notice that when we change the GL_PROJECTION mode 
   the camera is translated to the origin so we need to translate the z value 
   far back to get a decent view, as opposed to ortho perspective which has the 
   camera at infinity. 
2. This is because the ortho camera is at infinity while the perspective camera
   is at the tip of some frustum.
